# Data-Spark
**Project Overview**
This project involves a comprehensive process of cleaning, merging, and analyzing customer, sales, exchange rate, and store data. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide of the workflow followed:

**Step 1: Data Cleaning**
Reading the Data:
Utilized Python and Pandas to read the CSV files for customers, sales, exchange rates, and stores.
Handling Missing Values:
Identified and filled null values using appropriate methods.
Data Type Conversion:
Converted columns to their respective data types (e.g., dates, integers, floats).


**Step 2: Data Merging**
Merging Datasets:
Merged all cleaned data into a single DataFrame using the Pandas merge function with the inner join method.


**Step 3: Uploading Data to SQL**
Connecting to SQL Database:
Established a connection to the SQL database using SQLAlchemy.
Pushing Data to SQL:
Pushed the cleaned and merged DataFrame to the SQL database named capstone.


**Step 4: Data Analysis with SQL**
Writing SQL Queries:
Created SQL queries to analyze customer, sales, product, and store data.


**Step 5: Data Visualization with Power BI**
Uploading Queries:
Uploaded the results of each SQL query into Power BI.
Creating Visualizations:
Created visualizations to present insights from the data analysis.
